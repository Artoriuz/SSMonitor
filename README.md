Signal Strength Monitor
This project was designed and implemented by Matheus Góes, João Vitor Chrisóstomo and Marcos Castro for an Android app competition 
held in Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte in 2015.

The app monitors telephony signal strength and plots a bidimensional graph based on where you were. This way the user can track where 
signal strength wasn't exceptional.  

The app also won the competition.
